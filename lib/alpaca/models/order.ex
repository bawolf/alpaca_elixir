defmodule Alpaca.Order do
  @moduledoc """
  A resource that allows us to perform operations on an Order

  An order has the following methods we can call on it
  ```
  get/1
  list/1
  create/1
  edit/2
  delete_all/0
  delete/1
  get_by_client_order_id/1
  ```

  The `get/1` method allows us to get a singular order by calling `Alpaca.Order.get(id)`.
  Where `id` is the id of the order to get.

  The `list/1` method allows us to list all orders by calling `Alpaca.Order.list(params)`.
  Where `params` is a Map of optional params you can use to retrieve orders
  defined in the Alpaca API documentation

  The `create/1` method allows us to create a new order by calling `Alpaca.Order.create(params)`.
  Where `params` is the Map of parameters to create the order

  The `edit/2` method allows us to edit a specific order by calling `Alpaca.Order.edit(id, params)`.
  Where `id` is the id of the order and `params` are the parameters of the order we want to
  change defined by the Alpaca API documentation.

  The `delete_all/0` method allows us to delete all open orders by calling `Alpaca.Order.delete_all()`.

  The `delete/1` method allows us to delete a specific order by calling `Alpaca.Order.delete(id)`.
  Where `id` is the id of the order we want to delete.

  The `get_by_client_order_id/1` method allows us to get a specific order by the client order id by calling
  `Alpaca.Order.get_by_client_order_id(client_order_id)`. Where client_order_id is the client order id on the order.

  Retrieve an order by client order id

  ### Example
  ```
    iex> {:ok, %{} = order} = Alpaca.Order.get_by_client_order_id(client_order_id)
  ```

  Allows us to retrieve our an order as a result tuple `{:ok, %{}}`
